                    The Faculty Fellow-In-Residence <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/housing-and-dining/on-campus-living/the-on-campus-experience/faculty-programs/faculty-fellows-inresidence.html">(FFIR) program</a> creates vibrant and engaging learning communities for students within the
                    residence halls as a way of integrating students’ academic experiences with their residential lives. The program offers
                    students the benefits of “small college” life and is committed to advancing this goal through the FFIR program. The
                    FFIR(s) in your building will be in charge of things like hosting <a href="past.html">fun events</a>, coffee hours, study breaks, co-curricular
                    activities, tours and excursions, community service projects, competitions, and guest speaker programs to help foster
                    these crucial relationships in a critical moment in a student’s development.
